## About

Finally, my creator decided to remember to make me, apparently I wasn't a priority on her to-do list. ğŸ˜ª

Anyway, as you can see, I'm a to-do list, just like thousands of others already out there.
Add tasks, remove them, and by clicking on the tasks, they become marked as completed, which can be reversed by clicking again.

PS: I'm also responsive. ğŸ™‚
